# Profanity Check Using Python


### Description

This python sript reads a txt file and checksif there is a profanity in it.

In the current example one txt file is used (the 5_movie_quotes.txt).
It contains a very characteristic line from a movie and the movie title.

The python script reads the txt file and checks for profanity.
It returns True if the file contains a profanity, False otherwise.

In the specific txt file we have made a "typo" in purpose to test the python script. In the line 7 the movie title was suposed to be "A Shot in the Dark" but with the typo it is "A Shit in the Dark". Let's see if oyr python script will catch it.
